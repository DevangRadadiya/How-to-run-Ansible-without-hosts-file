Question:
. How to run Ansible without specifying the inventory but the host directly?
. Run a playbook or command with arbitrary host not in the inventory hosts list?
. run ansible with arbitrary host/ip without inventory?

Answer:
you can do like this:

ansible-playbook -i "<hostname-or-ip>, test.yml
Note the , at the end of the IP address, or it will be considered a hosts inventory filename.

Here is an example for reference:
ansible-playbook -i x.x.x.x, test.yml

NOTE : Requires 'hosts: all' in the playbook
